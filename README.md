## ðŸ“œ Lore Snapshot
In the Starchborn Age, **Echoes** are memory made real â€” currency, power, and life itself.  
You are **Sir Atarms**, the Potato Knight, roaming shifting realms where death is a lesson and every return leaves a scar.  
Some chase the **First Thread** to master the Netsouls. You just aim to endure.
